# SampleSoapClient

This project uses maven to create a Sample Soap Web Client that is
packaged as a jar file.

To compile the jar file:

`mvn clean package`

The jar file will be available in the **target** subdirectory.

There are two clients available in this project.  

The **SampleSoapClient** is created using stubs generated by the wsdl2java.sh script.

`./wsdl2java.sh -uri <location_of_wsdl> -p com.sample.stub -d adb`

This was done separate from the build for now.  The generated source was saved here.
Eventually I plan to automate the generation of these stub sources.

The **DynamicSoapClient** does not rely on generated stubs, but uses axiom objects to
dynamically create the remote call to the server.
